# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of myself for using my problem solving skills to get to a solution much quicker and much more efficiently. It also helped me be able to understand the material much better and I now feel more confident in my abilities. I am also proud of myself for not having to look at ruby docs for some of the methods used in the methods portion of the assignment, and for not having to look up what string interpolation is or how it works. Overall, this assignment was a big confidence booster for me because it helped me realize I am much more knowledgable on these topics than I orginally thought I was.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- The power of using methods in our applications allows us to get the desired output much easier and requires less code. It also allows us to be able to reuse code, helps keep the code more oganized and readable, as well as making it easier to navigate and collaborate.
